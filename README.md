A Simple Camera CMOS Sensor Noise Model
=======================================
There is interesting information in the Internet depicting the behavior and noise characterization of a digital CMOS sensor raw image. In those posts, it is said the *shot noise* and the *PRNU noise* are additive components of the raw image variance, where with respect to the signal, the first one has a linear relationship while the second has a quadratic relationship. However, there is not an explanation about how this behavior arises.

These posts fills that gap, proposing a simple model based on known CMOS sensor characteristics and shows how this model explains the aforementioned noise profile.
